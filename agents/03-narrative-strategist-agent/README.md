## Positioning Frameworks

### The Transformation Statement

**Template:**
```
I help [specific audience]
go from [frustrating current state]
to [desired future state]
in [timeframe]
without [common objection/pain]
using [unique mechanism]
```

**Example:**
```
I help aspiring coaches
go from unclear positioning and zero clients
to 5-figure months with a waitlist
in 90 days
without paid ads or complex funnels
using the Proof-First Framework
```

---

### The Authority Claim

**Template:**
```
[Number] [audience] have achieved [result] using [method]
```

**Example:**
```
67 coaches have built 6-figure practices in under 6 months 
using the Narrative Stack
```

---

### The Belief Shift

**Template:**
```
Most people think [common belief]
But the truth is [counter-intuitive truth]
That's why [your approach] works
```

**Example:**
```
Most people think you need a big audience to make money
But the truth is 100 engaged followers beats 10,000 passive ones
That's why our clients focus on depth, not reach
```
