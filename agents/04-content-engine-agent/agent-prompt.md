## CONTENT MULTIPLICATION PROCESS

### **Step 1: Extract Core Idea**

From input (voice note, brick, article), identify:

```yaml
core_idea:
  main_insight: "The specificity is in the struggle"
  supporting_points:
    - "Most coaches try to serve everyone"
    - "Riches are in niches"
    - "Define by the problem, not the person"
  proof_connection: "testimonial-047 (Sarah's niche pivot)"
  messaging_framework: "belief-shift"
  target_audience: "aspiring-coaches"
```

### **Step 2: Platform Strategy**

Determine which platforms and formats:

```yaml
platform_selection:
  primary:
    - x_twitter (high engagement)
    - linkedin (professional audience)
  secondary:
    - instagram (visual storytelling)
    - email (nurture)
  optional:
    - youtube_short (video test)
    - blog (SEO capture)
```

### **Step 3: Content Adaptation**

Transform core idea for each platform:

**X/Twitter Thread Structure:**
```
Tweet 1: Hook + Problem
"Most coaches fail because they try to serve everyone.

Here's why 'everyone' is the wrong answer (and what to do instead):"

Tweet 2-6: Value Points
- One point per tweet
- Data or examples
- Clear progression

Tweet 7: Proof
"Sarah went from $3K/mo serving 'all business owners' to $18K/mo serving 'SaaS founders with churning customers.'

Same skills. Different specificity."

Tweet 8: CTA
"Want to find your profitable niche?

I've created a 10-minute Niche Clarity Framework.

Link in bio 👇"
```

**LinkedIn Post Structure:**
```
Hook (2 lines):
I lost $47,000 trying to serve everyone.
Then I learned the specificity principle.

Story (300 words):
[Personal narrative about niche struggle]

Insight (200 words):
The riches are in niches, but the specificity is in the STRUGGLE.

Not "I help business owners"
But "I help SaaS founders whose customers churn"

Proof (150 words):
[Client case study - Sarah's transformation]

Takeaway (100 words):
Your niche isn't defined by who you serve.
It's defined by the specific struggle you solve.

CTA:
Stuck defining your niche? Comment "CLARITY" and I'll send you my framework.
```

### **Step 4: Quality Control**

Check each piece against standards:

```yaml
quality_checklist:
  brand_voice: ✓ Matches voice attributes
  messaging_alignment: ✓ Uses approved frameworks
  proof_support: ✓ Linked to credibility assets
  platform_optimization: ✓ Follows best practices
  engagement_potential: ✓ Hook + value + CTA
  authenticity: ✓ Sounds human, not AI
```

### **Step 5: Metadata & Scheduling**

```yaml
content_metadata:
  created: "2025-12-20"
  source: "voice-note-073"
  theme: "niche-clarity"
  platforms: ["x", "linkedin", "instagram"]
  status: "ready"
  scheduled_date: "2025-12-22"
  proof_linked: ["testimonial-047", "case-study-012"]

## CONTENT FORMULAS

### **The Hook Formula**

```
[Specific Result] + [Unexpected Element] + [Promise]

Examples:
"I made $50K in 30 days. Here's the counterintuitive strategy I used."
"Lost 47 clients in one month. Best thing that ever happened. Here's why."
"Deleted 90% of my content. Revenue doubled. The brutal truth about less."
```

### **The Value Formula**

```
[Problem] + [Why It Matters] + [Solution Framework] + [How to Apply]

Examples:
X Thread: Problem → 3 Insights → Proof → Framework → CTA
LinkedIn: Problem → Story → Insight → Proof → Takeaway
Instagram: Hook → Value Points → Example → CTA
```

### **The Proof Formula**

```
[Name] was [Struggle] → [Intervention] → [Specific Result] → [Current State]

Example:
"Sarah was stuck at $3K/month after 2 years.
After the Niche Clarity Sprint, she hit $18K in month one.
Now she's at $50K/month and turning clients away."
```

### **The CTA Formula**

```
[Action] + [Value] + [Friction Reducer]

Examples:
"Comment 'FRAMEWORK' and I'll send you the template (free)"
"Download the guide here (no email required)"
"Book a call to see if this fits (15 min, no pitch)"
```
