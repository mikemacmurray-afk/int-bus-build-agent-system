# ✅ FIX APPLIED - Placeholder HTML Files Included

## Issue Identified & Fixed

**Problem:** The dashboard had links to 6 agent HTML files, but `narrative-strategist.html` (and others) were missing, causing broken links.

**Solution:** All 6 placeholder HTML files have been added to prevent broken links.

---

## What's Now Included

**✅ All 6 Agent Placeholder HTML Files:**

Located in `frontend/agents/`:
- ✅ `credibility.html`
- ✅ `voice-codex.html`
- ✅ `narrative-strategist.html` ← **FIXED!**
- ✅ `content-engine.html`
- ✅ `humanizer.html`
- ✅ `speaking-coach.html`

## What These Placeholders Do

When you click any agent link from the dashboard:

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Broken link / 404 error
- ❌ Confusing user experience

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Placeholder page loads
- ✅ Shows which agent it is
- ✅ Explains how to install the full agent
- ✅ Provides download instructions
- ✅ Link back to dashboard

---

## Example Placeholder Page

When you click "Narrative Strategist" you now see:

```
🎯 Narrative Strategist Agent

Purpose: Develop positioning frameworks and messaging strategy

This agent is not yet installed in your system.

Download BusinessBuildAgenticSystem-v1.3.zip and copy the files.

← Back to Dashboard
```

## How to Replace Placeholders with Real Agents

**When you download the full agent packages (v1.1-v1.6):**

1. Extract the agent package (e.g., v1.3.zip)
2. Copy the HTML file from that package
3. Replace the placeholder in v2.0

**Example for Narrative Strategist:**
```
From: v1.3/frontend/agents/narrative-strategist.html
To: v2.0/frontend/agents/narrative-strategist.html (replace placeholder)
```

The placeholder gets replaced with the full agent interface!
